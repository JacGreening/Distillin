                Canadian whiskey is a type of whisky produced in Canada. Most Canadian whiskies are blended. Meaning they are a lighter,
                smoother, style of whiskey. Canadian whiskeys is created from a primarily corn base that has some rye added to the mash
                bill to give it more flavour. It came to be known as rye. In Canada, Candian Whiskey and Canadian Rye are used and referenced 
                interchangeabley. Canadian regulations state that whisky must "be mashed, distilled and aged in Canada", "be aged in small 
                wood vessels for not less than three years", "contain not less than 40 per cent alcohol by volume" and "may contain 
                caramel and flavouring". Within these parameters Canadian whiskies can vary considerably, especially with the allowance of 
                "flavouring"—though the additional requirement that they "possess the aroma, taste and character generally attributed to 
                Canadian whisky" can act as a limiting factor.

            <p>Tennessee whiskey is straight whiskey produced in the U.S. state of Tennessee. Tennessee whiskey must be filtered through a thick 
                layer of sugar-maple charcoal before aging, which helps remove impurites and softens the spirit. The process of aging whisky in charcoal. 
                The Lincoln County Process is thought to improve the whiskey's flavor by jump-starting the aging process, removing more congeners, 
                even before the whiskey is poured into charred oak barrels for aging. Tennessee whiskey must be produced in the state of Tennessee, 
                which is a requirement set by law.The Lincoln County Process gives Tennessee whiskey its smooth and mellow flavor, distinguishing it from 
                other types of whiskey such as bourbon or rye. These unique characteristics contribute to the distinct flavor profile and popularity 
                of Tennessee whiskey, making it a sought-after spirit in the American whiskey market.

                it has gained international recognition for its exceptional quality and complexity. Japanese whisky is produced in several different 
                styles, each with its own unique characteristics and flavor profile. Some of the most popular styles include single malt, blended, 
                and grain whiskies. The distilleries, such as Suntory and Nikka, are known for their exceptional whiskies and have become iconic in the
